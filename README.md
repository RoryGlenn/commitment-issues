**Local Git hooks for developers who overthink every commit.**

GitHub Actions catches mistakes after they become expensive.
Commitment Issues catches them while they are still cheap.

Stop test failures, staged secrets, and Git mistakes before they reach your repo.

## Commit normally. Fix safely. Push with confidence.

Checks start advisory. Fixes run only when requested and when the repository
state proves the operation safe. Teams can opt into individual blocking gates
after they trust the signal.

## Why before CI?

CI remains the authoritative shared gate. Local checks catch problems while the
developer still has the relevant code in mind, avoiding a queue wait, context
switch, log investigation, correction push, and second CI run for issues that
could have been identified immediately.

[See the feedback-latency and measurement model](docs/why-before-ci.md).

## Quickstart

You need Git, Node.js >=22.11.0, ESLint 9 with a flat config, and Prettier 3.

```bash
npm install -D commitment-issues eslint@^9 prettier@^3
npx --no-install commitment-issues init --dry-run
npx --no-install commitment-issues init
```

Then commit and push normally:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "your message"
git push
```

When the tool reports a safe fix path:

```bash
npm run fix:staged   # fix the current staged files before committing
npm run commit:fix   # fix and amend the latest clean, unpushed commit
```

Hooks resolve ESLint and Prettier only from the project's installed
`node_modules`. A missing tool stays advisory and prints the detected package
manager's install command; the hook does not ask `npx` to download it.

## Why it is different

- **Advisory adoption:** warnings first; enforcement is per-check opt-in.
- **Safe explicit fixes:** ambiguous partial staging, dirty tracked worktrees,
  and pushed history are refused.
- **Related push tests:** runs tests associated with the files being pushed.
- **Native hook ownership:** no Husky, lint-staged, or separate hook manager.
- **Self-repair:** `doctor` restores missing generated hooks after install or
  clone without overwriting custom hooks.
- **Local and reversible:** no account or telemetry; preview setup and removal
  with `--dry-run`.

## What it catches

| Check                                    | Default                             | Optional enforcement           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Lint and formatting drift                | Reports findings and safe fix paths | Fix commands remain explicit   |
| Missing nearby tests                     | Warns with path exemptions          | —                              |
| Related staged tests                     | Off until enabled                   | —                              |
| Related pushed-file tests                | Advisory after `init`               | `blockPushOnTestFailure`       |
| Protected branches                       | Warns on direct commit/push         | `blockProtectedBranches`       |
| Likely staged secrets and dotenv files   | Warns with file/line detail         | `blockOnSecrets`               |
| Branch behind upstream                   | Suggests pulling or rebasing        | —                              |
| Oversized commits, large/generated files | Suggests a safer next step          | —                              |
| Commit messages through commitlint       | Off until enabled, then advisory    | `commitMessage.blockOnFailure` |
| Broken generated hook wiring             | `doctor` reports and repairs        | —                              |

## How it works

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/project-flowchart-dark.svg">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/project-flowchart-light.svg">
  <img alt="commitment-issues project flowchart showing setup, Git hook wiring, code and guard checks before commit, safe fix paths, and pre-push tests" src="assets/project-flowchart-light.svg">
</picture>

`init` writes native `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and `.git/hooks/pre-push` files.
When commit-message linting is enabled, it also owns `.git/hooks/commit-msg`.
The hooks invoke the installed binary; package source is not copied into the
repository. Existing custom hooks and foreign `core.hooksPath` values are
preserved and reported for manual composition.

## From advisory to enforced

| Action            | Default after `init`                                                              | Stricter option                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `git commit`      | Reports lint, formatting, missing-test, secret, branch, and commit-shape findings | Enable the relevant secret or branch blocker |
| `git push`        | Runs related pushed-file tests in advisory mode                                   | Enable `blockPushOnTestFailure`              |
| Commit message    | Off until enabled, then advisory                                                  | Enable `commitMessage.blockOnFailure`        |
| Automatic changes | Only explicit fix commands                                                        | No implicit mutation mode                    |

When `blockPushOnTestFailure` and `advisePushTests` are both set, blocking takes
precedence. Roll out one enforcement choice at a time after the team has
observed its false-positive and failure behavior.

## Privacy and trust

- Commit/push checks do not mutate tracked files.
- Fix commands stop when Git cannot prove the operation safe.
- Configuration is validated JSON; project JavaScript is not imported.
- Built-in tools use local executables and argument arrays without shell
  interpolation.
- Test commands inherit the normal developer environment but not Git's
  hook-local repository routing, so nested Git fixtures resolve from their own
  working directory.
- The package adds no telemetry, repository upload, account, or hosted service.
- A configured `testCommand` remains repository-owned executable code and may
  have behavior of its own.

## Removal

```bash
npx --no-install commitment-issues uninstall --dry-run
npx --no-install commitment-issues uninstall
npm remove commitment-issues
```

Removal deletes only exact generated setup. Customized scripts/hooks and shared
dependencies, ignores, and lockfiles are preserved.
