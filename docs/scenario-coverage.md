# Scenario Coverage

> **Audience:** maintainers and auditors. This repository-only matrix is not
> installed with the npm package. Scenario identifiers map claims to concrete
> tests, workflows, or an explicit manual/deferred disposition; update the map
> whenever that evidence changes.

This tracker turns the exhaustive scenario list into an implementation plan. Update it whenever a scenario is covered, deferred, or intentionally left manual.

The command, Git-state, lifecycle, finding, and file-ownership evidence for
production-readiness workstream #130 is consolidated in the
[core CLI and Git behavior audit](audits/core-cli-git.md).

## Status values

- **Covered** — automated coverage exists and is expected to run in CI.
- **Partial** — some coverage exists, but important variants remain.
- **Not covered** — no meaningful automated coverage yet.
- **Manual** — best validated manually for now.
- **Deferred** — intentionally not implemented yet.
- **Not applicable** — out of scope for this package.

## Covered

### Test strategy and coverage enforcement

- **TEST-001** — every published runtime module has an explicit, existing test
  owner that references it, and the ownership set exactly matches the
  fail-closed coverage denominator. Unit/invariant: `test/test-quality.test.mjs`;
  map: `docs/branch-coverage.md`.
- **TEST-002** — the only coverage suppressions are the two documented
  post-preflight filesystem races; new or enlarged suppressions fail the
  inventory. Unit/invariant: `test/test-quality.test.mjs`.
- **TEST-003** — deleted tests are not executed, while a deleted source, a
  source-only rename, and a combined source+test rename cannot evade blocking
  related-test selection. Real-Git fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **TEST-004** — all 64 generated message-state assets are gallery-owned and
  exactly reproducible in a private temporary directory. Unit/subprocess:
  `test/visual-assets.test.mjs`.
- **TEST-005** — the aggregate branch-protection gate succeeds only when DCO,
  the complete OS/Node check matrix, and the package-manager lifecycle matrix
  each report explicit success; skipped or incomplete dependencies fail closed.
  Unit/invariant: `test/test-quality.test.mjs`; CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **TEST-006** — exact logo content and fresh-value behavior are directly
  asserted rather than credited through incidental coverage. Unit:
  `test/logo.test.mjs`.

### Package publishing

- **PKG-001** — package metadata stays consistent with lockfile. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **PKG-002** — package README documents the Node engine. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **PKG-003** — package description does not contradict configurable blocking. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **PKG-004** — package `files` entries exist. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **PKG-005** — package bin works from a packed tarball across the OS / Node matrix. CI lifecycle integration: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; runner: `scripts/run-lifecycle-test.mjs`.
- **PKG-006** — README relative image assets, including HTML `<img>` sources, exist and are included in package `files`. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **PKG-007** — package includes only README-required SVG assets and the explicit
  user-documentation allowlist; repository-only galleries and maintainer
  evidence stay out of the tarball. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs` using
  `npm pack --dry-run --json`.
- **PKG-008** — the packed script set equals the complete runtime coverage set,
  includes every relative runtime import and public bin target, and excludes
  every lifecycle/coverage maintenance module. Unit:
  `test/metadata.test.mjs`; full installed behavior: package-manager lifecycle
  matrix.
- **PKG-009** — exact minimum supported Node version runs the full npm test and
  lifecycle matrix on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, plus every supported non-npm
  lifecycle on Ubuntu. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **PKG-010** — package excludes promotional raster/video media and enforces compressed/unpacked size budgets. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **PKG-011** — the publish workflow packs once, lifecycle-tests the exact
  tarball, confirms its CLI bin/shebang/version on every platform and normalized
  0755/0644 file modes on POSIX/release producers, then hashes, uploads, and
  publishes that unchanged artifact. Windows lanes retain platform-relevant
  bin-shim, installability, and digest checks. SLSA generation remains separate,
  and one final immutable-release uploader owns the tarball and provenance.
  Unit/invariant:
  `test/release-integrity.test.mjs`; integration:
  `test/integration/lifecycle-manager.test.mjs` and
  `scripts/ci-lifecycle-smoke.mjs`; tracking: #182.
- **PKG-012** — release preflight rejects local/remote tag, GitHub Release, and
  npm-version collisions and fails closed when a registry cannot be checked.
  Unit: `test/release-integrity.test.mjs`.
- **PKG-013** — release verification uses supported npm signature/attestation
  surfaces rather than the absent `npm view ... provenance` field. Unit:
  `test/release-integrity.test.mjs`.
- **PKG-014** — version tags fetch complete canonical history and fail before
  release-capable work unless their commit is an ancestor of `origin/main`.
  Repository tag rules remain the external release-authority boundary.
  Unit/fixture: `test/release-integrity.test.mjs`; tracking: #94.
- **PKG-015** — partial-publication recovery distinguishes `before-npm`,
  `after-npm`, and `complete` states; inconsistent or unavailable evidence and
  source/digest mismatches fail closed. Before-npm requires no GitHub draft or
  release, and incomplete recovery requires `latest` to remain on the candidate.
  The final job cryptographically verifies local SLSA provenance; every existing
  draft asset must be byte-identical, so a draft containing provenance can
  resume only through a failed-job rerun retaining the original bundle.
  Published partial releases cannot resume. Registry metadata changes and
  unpublish remain outside automation. Mocked unit: `test/release-recovery.test.mjs`;
  workflow invariant:
  `test/release-integrity.test.mjs`; classifier: `tools/release-recovery.mjs`;
  tracking: #183.
- **PKG-016** — release validation requires `package.json`, both root lockfile
  version records, the exact `vX.Y.Z` tag, one dated changelog section, the
  GitHub Release title, and its non-empty reviewed body to agree. The final
  action publishes the extracted changelog section instead of generating or
  maintaining separate notes. A schema-checked ledger preserves the exact
  v3.3.0–v3.3.2 irregularities without allowing prospective empty-note
  exceptions. Unit: `test/release-metadata.test.mjs` and
  `test/release-recovery.test.mjs`; workflow invariant:
  `test/release-integrity.test.mjs`; validator:
  `tools/validate-release-metadata.mjs`; tracking: #184.
- **PKG-017** — every relative link in shipped Markdown resolves inside the
  exact `npm pack` manifest; repository-only targets use canonical GitHub URLs
  instead of entering the package accidentally. Positive and negative unit:
  `test/packed-markdown-links.test.mjs`; real manifest:
  `test/metadata.test.mjs`; clean installed copy across package managers:
  `scripts/ci-lifecycle-smoke.mjs`; tracking: #186.

### Path normalization

- **PATH-001** — POSIX paths normalize correctly. Unit: `test/path-normalization.test.mjs`.
- **PATH-002** — Windows backslash paths normalize correctly. Unit: `test/path-normalization.test.mjs`.
- **PATH-003** — mixed separators normalize correctly. Unit: `test/path-normalization.test.mjs`.
- **PATH-004** — spaces and Unicode survive path normalization. Unit: `test/path-normalization.test.mjs`.
- **PATH-005** — equivalent test paths dedupe after normalization. Unit: `test/path-normalization.test.mjs`.

### Docs drift

- **DOC-001** — README avoids unconditional non-blocking claims. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **DOC-002** — README documents advisory push mode. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **DOC-003** — README documents blocking push mode. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **DOC-004** — README image references cannot drift away from packaged assets. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **DOC-005** — supported Node version stays consistent across the README, docs, and workflows. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **DOC-006** — every allowlisted `precommitChecks` key appears in the canonical
  user configuration reference and maintainer authoring skill; the external
  interface links to that canonical table. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.
- **DOC-007** — the aggregate CI gate includes DCO and every prospective-enforcement surface names the same immutable baseline. Unit: `test/metadata.test.mjs`.

### Promotional demo

- **DEMO-001** — the render workflow preserves the generated artifact and
  independently enforces dimensions, frame-count drift, duration drift, and
  normalized visual similarity. Unit: `test/visual-assets.test.mjs`.
- **DEMO-002** — visual comparison masks only the four documented volatile
  values, searches only the metadata-bounded frame offsets, accepts those
  differences, and rejects synthetic missing-scene, color, layout, and clipping
  regressions. Unit/integration: `test/demo-visual-comparison.test.mjs`.

### Config

- **CFG-001** — valid `precommitChecks` loads. Unit: `test/config.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-002** — missing `package.json` degrades to `{}`. Unit: `test/config.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-003** — invalid package JSON degrades to `{}` with an explicit source warning. Unit: `test/config.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-004** — missing `precommitChecks` degrades to `{}`. Unit: `test/config.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-005** — malformed `precommitChecks` containers are ignored with an explicit source warning. Fuzz unit: `test/config.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-006** — malformed option values inside an object are tolerated. Fuzz unit: `test/config.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-007** — `.commitmentrc.json` loads direct top-level options without executing code. Unit/subprocess: `test/config.test.mjs`, `test/precommit.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-008** — standalone keys shallowly override matching package keys while preserving unmatched package options; invalid higher-priority values do not revive lower-priority values. Unit/subprocess: `test/config.test.mjs`, `test/precommit.test.mjs`, `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-009** — malformed JSON and non-object standalone roots warn at hook time and fall back to package configuration. Unit/subprocess: `test/config.test.mjs`, `test/precommit.test.mjs`, `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-010** — nested `commitMessage` keys are allowlisted, sanitized, typo-diagnosed, and disabled unless `enabled: true`. Unit: `test/config.test.mjs`.
- **CFG-011** — valid standalone values remain active when the package source is malformed; hooks surface the package failure instead of changing policy silently. Unit/subprocess: `test/config.test.mjs`, `test/precommit.test.mjs`.

- **CLI-020** — the hidden `vows` command dispatches successfully, renders one deterministic color-aware box, wraps in narrow terminals, and leaves worktree, package, Git config, and hook state unchanged. Unit/subprocess: `test/vows.test.mjs`, `test/cli.test.mjs`.
- **CLI-021** — every public command's option/positional boundary is documented; unsupported options and excess arguments fail before dispatch can mutate state. Subprocess: `test/cli.test.mjs`, `test/init.test.mjs`, `test/doctor.test.mjs`, `test/uninstall.test.mjs`.

- **INIT-022** — malformed standalone configuration stops init before package, hook, or gitignore writes. Fixture: `test/init.test.mjs`.
- **INIT-023** — commit-msg wiring is opt-in, dry-run aware, executable, idempotent, and never overwrites a custom hook. Fixture: `test/init.test.mjs`, unit: `test/hooks.test.mjs`.
- **INIT-024** — init derives commit-msg wiring from the merged effective
  package/standalone configuration; standalone-only enablement, disabled or
  invalid standalone precedence, dry-run, idempotence, and a packed mixed-source

- **INIT-033** — setup and dry-run refuse linked or non-regular mutable project
  files before package, configuration, gitignore, or hook changes; stable
  descriptor and identity checks protect the final write boundary. Unit/fixture:

### Pre-commit checks

- **PRE-001** — auto-fixable formatting/lint warnings recommend `npm run commit:fix` (and pluralize). Fixture: `test/precommit.test.mjs`.
- **PRE-002** — a mix of fixable and manual issues recommends `commit:fix` and still flags the manual work. Fixture: `test/precommit.test.mjs`.
- **PRE-003** — `commit:fix` is suppressed when tracked worktree changes would block a safe amend. Fixture: `test/precommit.test.mjs`.
- **PRE-004** — non-fixable ESLint issues are labeled manual with no `commit:fix`, including messages with no rule id. Fixture: `test/precommit.test.mjs`.

- **PRE-012** — JSON mode covers skipped, clean, advisory, and invalid-argument results without changing human output or exit codes. Fixture: `test/json-output.test.mjs`.
- **PRE-013** — staged test selection preserves leading/trailing whitespace, tabs, newlines, and Unicode in real Git pathnames. Fixture: `test/precommit.test.mjs`.
- **PRE-014** — detached HEAD intentionally skips only the branch-name guard while unrelated staged guards continue. Fixture: `test/commit-guards-integration.test.mjs`.
- **PRE-015** — the default-on Commit Owl welcome appears once per clone as the sole final box for an eligible clean/informational result, uses a Git-common-directory marker shared by linked worktrees, stays readable at narrow widths, and supports an explicit opt-out. Unit/fixture: `test/welcome.test.mjs`.
- **PRE-016** — JSON mode, `--no-verify`, `COMMITMENT_ISSUES=0`, and legacy `HUSKY=0` neither display nor consume the welcome; marker probe/write/render failures never block checks. Unit/real-Git fixture: `test/welcome.test.mjs`.
- **PRE-017** — a first-run warning or error takes priority without rendering or consuming the welcome, preserving the one-box invariant in both hook-output modes. Unit/fixture: `test/welcome.test.mjs`.

### Commit-message linting

- **CMSG-001** — disabled by default: no commit-msg hook and a direct invocation is silent. Fixture: `test/commit-msg.test.mjs`, `test/init.test.mjs`.
- **CMSG-002** — advisory findings preserve commitlint detail and allow; explicit `blockOnFailure` rejects the same result. Fixture: `test/commit-msg.test.mjs`.
- **CMSG-003** — only an absolute project `node_modules/.bin/commitlint` invocation is allowed; message paths containing spaces/metacharacters stay one argv value and no npx/global/network fallback exists. Unit: `test/process.test.mjs`; fixture: `test/commit-msg.test.mjs`.
- **CMSG-004** — missing local CLI, missing consumer config, unreadable message files, and successful runs have distinct outcomes; no built-in rules are substituted. Fixture: `test/commit-msg.test.mjs`.
- **CMSG-005** — generated hooks block when configured and Git `--no-verify` bypasses without invoking commitlint. Real-Git fixture: `test/commit-msg.test.mjs`.
- **CMSG-006** — standard and fun tones preserve severity/exit behavior. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`; fixture: `test/commit-msg.test.mjs`.

- **CFIX-009** — warns when a format-only file cannot be fixed automatically. Fixture: `test/commit-fix.test.mjs`.
- **CFIX-010** — Git failures error clearly: no commit, worktree/file-list/staging/staged-fix inspection, and amend failure. Fixture: `test/commit-fix.test.mjs`.
- **CFIX-011** — committed pathnames with leading/trailing whitespace, tabs, newlines, and Unicode are fixed and amended exactly. Fixture: `test/commit-fix.test.mjs`.

### Staged fixes

- **STG-001** — `fix:staged` applies auto-fixes and refreshes the index; reports already clean when nothing changes (pluralized, tolerant of an unreadable index snapshot). Fixture: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **STG-002** — `fix:staged` warns when fixes apply but non-fixable lint issues remain. Fixture: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **STG-003** — `fix:staged` shows an info box when there are no staged fixable files. Fixture: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **STG-004** — `fix:staged` refuses partially staged files and files missing from the working tree. Fixture: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **STG-005** — `fix:staged` errors when staged or unstaged files cannot be inspected. Fixture: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **STG-006** — `fix-staged-js` formats JS/TS and exits 0 when everything is auto-fixable. Fixture: `test/fix-staged-js.test.mjs`.
- **STG-007** — `fix-staged-js` exits 1 on remaining non-fixable lint or a Prettier parse error. Fixture: `test/fix-staged-js.test.mjs`.
- **STG-008** — `fix-staged-js` exits 0 immediately when given no file arguments. Fixture: `test/fix-staged-js.test.mjs`.
- **STG-009** — staged pathnames with leading/trailing whitespace, tabs, newlines, and Unicode are fixed and restaged exactly. Fixture: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.

### Doctor and hook health

- **HOOK-001** — doctor wires native `.git/hooks` files in a fresh repo. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-002** — doctor reports healthy when the wiring is intact. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-003** — doctor migrates husky-era wiring (retires `core.hooksPath`, writes native hooks) and warns about stranded user `.husky` hooks. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-004** — doctor recreates a missing hook file without overwriting existing ones. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-005** — custom hooks that still invoke `commitment-issues` are accepted as healthy. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-006** — custom pre-commit/pre-push hooks that never invoke `commitment-issues` are reported and left untouched. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-007** — `doctor --quiet` warns but exits 0 when a custom hook does not invoke `commitment-issues`. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-008** — `doctor --quiet` stays silent when healthy and reports repairs in one line. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-009** — `doctor --quiet` never breaks an install (no git repo, or repair cannot complete). Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-010** — interactive doctor errors clearly: no `package.json`, unrepairable wiring, or still broken after repair. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-011** — a foreign `core.hooksPath` is respected: healthy when its hooks invoke the tool, reported (never rewired) when they do not. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-012** — doctor reports malformed standalone configuration while continuing hook repair; quiet mode remains one-line and exit-zero. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-013** — comments, echo/printf output, assignments, and quoted examples do not count as hook wiring; executable custom invocations and exact generated hooks remain healthy for all hook names. Unit/fixture: `test/hooks.test.mjs`, `test/init.test.mjs`, `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-014** — non-executable custom hooks are reported with shell-safe `chmod +x` guidance on POSIX and are never modified by init or doctor. Unit/fixture: `test/hooks.test.mjs`, `test/init.test.mjs`, `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-015** — doctor creates and fresh-clone repairs configured commit-msg wiring, preserves custom bodies, requires quoted `$1`, and warns without failing when the local CLI is absent. Fixture: `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-016** — bare repositories are rejected for local hook health; quiet install-time repair remains silent and exit-zero. Unit/fixture: `test/hooks.test.mjs`, `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-017** — failed `core.hooksPath` probes fail safely instead of being mistaken for an unset value. Unit/fixture: `test/hooks.test.mjs`, `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-018** — directory, unreadable, and otherwise uninspectable hook paths are preserved and reported without raw exceptions. Unit/fixture: `test/hooks.test.mjs`, `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **HOOK-019** — configured hook paths use Git's effective path resolution, including tilde expansion. Unit/fixture: `test/hooks.test.mjs`, `test/doctor.test.mjs`, `test/uninstall.test.mjs`.

### Pre-push modes

- **PUSH-001** — disabled by default: silent and allows during a real push, and explains how to enable a mode when run interactively. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-002** — blocking mode runs only the pushed files' tests and blocks on failure; a pass shows a summary and allows. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-003** — advisory mode runs tests and warns without blocking; a pass shows a summary. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-004** — `blockPushOnTestFailure` takes precedence over `advisePushTests`, and the dual-mode conflict is surfaced. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-005** — deleted test files are never executed; deleting or renaming a source file still runs any surviving related test and blocks when it fails. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-006** — falls back to the upstream branch when run without piped refs. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-007** — non-node test commands run through the tee/summary fallback. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-008** — test-command failure blocks in blocking mode and warns/allows in advisory mode; a missing summary blocks. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-009** — pushed-file diff failure or malformed name/status output fails closed in blocking mode, warns/allows in advisory mode, and stays silent when disabled. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-010** — JSON mode preserves Git's pre-push positional arguments, keeps subprocess output off stdout, and reports advisory, clean, and blocking outcomes. Fixture: `test/json-output.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-011** — the first push of a based branch uses its closest safe remote merge base; orphan histories fall back to the empty tree, and multiple pushed refs are evaluated independently. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-012** — same-basename sources in separate packages select only their own package-relative tests; a root basename fallback cannot steal the match. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-013** — pushed test selection passes leading/trailing whitespace, tabs, newlines, and Unicode pathnames exactly. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-014** — missing remotes fail safely, one remote can be inferred, and multiple remotes are never guessed when selecting a first-push base. Unit: `test/push-base.test.mjs`.

### Advisory message and tone

- **MSG-001** — a success message renders when there are no issues. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-002** — recommends `commit:fix` when amend is safe; suppressed when worktree changes block amend or it cannot be inspected. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-003** — mixed fixable + manual issues recommend `commit:fix` and flag manual work, including when amend is blocked. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-004** — no fix command is shown when nothing is auto-fixable. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-005** — an issue's detail lines render. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-006** — fun tone renders the "Relationship notes" variant from `precommitChecks.tone`. Subprocess: `test/fun-tone.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-007** — commit-message findings and setup failures render advisory/blocking and standard/fun variants with an explicit bypass. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.

### Internal helpers

- **LIB-001** — ESLint JSON summarizing and manual-issue extraction (totals, fixables, empty/invalid, missing rule id). Unit: `test/checks.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-002** — Prettier list parsing and Node test-summary parsing (TAP/spec, pass-only/fail-only, unrecognized → null). Unit: `test/checks.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-003** — test-exemption and glob logic: `isTestExemptFile`, `testExempt` globs, `globToRegExp`, and file classifiers. Unit: `test/lib-files.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-004** — package-aware test discovery and strict NUL-delimited Git-path helpers: `findTestFile(s)`, `collectTestsForFiles`, `parseNulPaths`, `parseLsFilesStage`, `parseNameStatusPaths`, and `shortFileList`. Unit: `test/lib-files.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-005** — shared box rendering colors the whole border, honors `NO_COLOR`/disabled color in captured CI output, preserves product-owned SGR styling while removing other terminal sequences, visibly escapes remaining C0/C1 controls, wraps long and Unicode content to the reported width, and recovers from malformed or impossibly narrow `COLUMNS` values. Unit/subprocess: `test/terminal.test.mjs`, `test/ui.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-006** — process outcomes distinguish missing tool, spawn failure, timeout, external signal, normal nonzero exit, and success. Unit: `test/process.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-007** — Prettier classification is exit-status-first; `[error]` in a filename remains a formatting path. Unit: `test/checks.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-008** — project-local optional-bin resolution walks ancestor `node_modules/.bin` directories while preserving argv and returning null instead of an implicit fallback. Unit: `test/local-tool.test.mjs`.

### Safety path matrix

- **SEC-001** — paths with spaces are passed as argv and through a staged-file flow. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-002** — paths with quotes are passed safely through argv and staged-file flows. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-003** — paths with semicolons are passed safely through argv and staged-file flows. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-004** — Unicode paths are passed safely through argv and staged-file flows. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-005** — Windows-style backslash tokens are passed as literal argv. Unit: `test/process.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-006** — glob-like filename characters are passed safely through a staged-file flow. Subprocess: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-007** — every runtime Git pathname list uses a structured NUL-delimited format; parsers never trim or newline-split pathnames. Source/fixtures: `scripts/precommit.mjs`, `scripts/fix-staged.mjs`, `scripts/commit-fix.mjs`, `scripts/prepush.mjs`, `test/lib-files.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-008** — accidentally staged `node_modules` files are skipped by pre-commit checks. Fixture: `test/precommit-dependency-ignore.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-009** — pre-push diff uses NUL-delimited name/status output, so deletions, renames/copies, Unicode, whitespace, tabs, and newlines remain unambiguous for associated-test discovery. Unit/subprocess: `test/lib-files.test.mjs`, `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-010** — staged-secret parsing distinguishes file headers from added hunk content, including source lines beginning with `++ `. Unit/subprocess: `test/secret-scan.test.mjs`, `test/secret-scan-integration.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-011** — missing ESLint/Prettier peers return an advisory and package-manager install hint without invoking `npx`; explicitly configured `npx` test commands remain verbatim. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/precommit.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-012** — opt-in secret enforcement fails closed when the staged-diff process fails, exits nonzero, or returns malformed patch structure; advisory mode warns and continues, and JSON preserves the distinction. Unit/subprocess: `test/secret-scan.test.mjs`, `test/secret-scan-integration.test.mjs`, `test/json-output.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-013** — Git C-style quoted staged-patch paths preserve tabs, newlines, quotes, backticks, dollar signs, semicolons, spaces, and Unicode; binary, rename, deletion, missing-final-newline, malformed, and large patch shapes remain structurally distinguished. Unit/subprocess: `test/secret-scan.test.mjs`, `test/secret-scan-integration.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-014** — discovered Node test paths beginning with `-` are positional files rather than runner options at commit and push time. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/precommit.test.mjs`, `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-015** — hook repair does not follow hook-file, dangling, or hook-directory symbolic links. Unit/subprocess: `test/hooks.test.mjs`, `test/doctor.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-016** — pre-push Node reporter output uses a randomized private temporary directory and does not reuse or delete a predictable colliding path. Subprocess: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-017** — hook-launched test commands and temporary-repository helpers remove Git's repository-local environment routing; representative `GIT_DIR`, work-tree, index, and counted-config variables cannot redirect fixture initialization into the caller. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/repository-shapes.test.mjs`, pre-push hook reproduction.
- **SEC-018** — mutable project-file writes reject symbolic links, non-regular
  paths, identity replacement, descriptor mismatch, and occupied missing-file
  paths instead of following repository-controlled links outside the checkout.
  Unit/subprocess: `test/lib-files.test.mjs`, `test/init-gitignore.test.mjs`,
  `test/init.test.mjs`, `test/uninstall.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-019** — product-owned human output visibly escapes
  repository-controlled C0/C1 bytes, strips injected CSI/OSC sequences from
  paths, refs, configuration, argv, and captured Git diagnostics, preserves
  intentional model lines and Unicode, and leaves raw child passthrough
  unchanged; JSON round-trips the exact semantic filename.
  Unit/real-Git/subprocess: `test/terminal.test.mjs`, `test/ui.test.mjs`,
  `test/lib-files.test.mjs`, `test/cli.test.mjs`, `test/doctor.test.mjs`,
  `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`, `test/commit-guards-integration.test.mjs`,
  `test/prepush.test.mjs`, `test/json-output.test.mjs`.

### Performance

- **PERF-001** — timeout is enforced and reported separately from signals/spawn failures. Fixture: precommit / prepush / process tests.
- **PERF-002** — timeout cleanup terminates an attached grandchild on supported platforms. Fixture: `test/process.test.mjs`; CI matrix: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows.

### User lifecycle

- **LIFE-001** — user installs and immediately commits in a fresh external repo. CI lifecycle integration: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`check` and `pm-lifecycle`); runner: `scripts/run-lifecycle-test.mjs`; fixture: `test/integration/lifecycle-manager.test.mjs`.
- **LIFE-002** — user installs and immediately pushes to a bare remote from a fresh external repo. CI lifecycle integration: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`check` and `pm-lifecycle`); runner: `scripts/run-lifecycle-test.mjs`; fixture: `test/integration/lifecycle-manager.test.mjs`.
- **LIFE-003** — advisory-only forever. Fixture/docs: README + prepush tests.
- **LIFE-004** — blocking on push. Fixture/docs: README + prepush tests.
- **LIFE-006** — a project-owned `prepare` survives init; after commit/push, a fresh clone's normal npm, pnpm, Yarn Classic, or Bun install runs the composed repair and recreates the local hooks. Yarn Berry 4.17.0 does not support `prepare` and disables `postinstall` by default, so its verified clone repair is the explicit local `doctor` command. CI lifecycle matrix: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; runner: `scripts/run-lifecycle-test.mjs`; fixture: `test/integration/lifecycle-manager.test.mjs`.
- **LIFE-007** — pinned immutable v2.5.1, v3.2.0, and v3.3.2 release fixtures upgrade to the candidate tarball, refresh or remove only exact generated state, preserve project-owned `prepare` logic and custom hooks, and execute the migrated hooks during a real commit and push. Required PR evidence: npm on Ubuntu/Node 24; release evidence: the exact publish tarball; scheduled evidence: pnpm, Yarn Classic, and Bun. Fixture: `test/integration/lifecycle-migration.test.mjs`.
- **LIFE-008** — installing an older release over newer configured state is explicitly unsupported. The documented rollback runs the current version's `uninstall`, restores a lockfile and manifest with the pinned target and peers, installs, and runs the target version's `init` and `doctor`; custom state remains subject to manual review. Contract: [Downgrades and manual rollback](migration.md#downgrades-and-manual-rollback); ownership fixture: `test/uninstall.test.mjs`.

### Package managers

- **PM-001** — package-manager detection (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun) via `npm_config_user_agent` and lockfiles, plus package-manager-aware command hints in advisory, `fix:staged`, and `doctor` output. Unit: `test/package-manager.test.mjs`. Subprocess: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **PM-002** — uninstall prints a package-removal command for the detected manager. Unit: `test/package-manager.test.mjs`. Fixture: `test/uninstall.test.mjs`.
- **PM-003** — pnpm 10 end-to-end lifecycle integration (pack → install → init → commit → push → repair → uninstall → dependency removal) on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows at Node 24, plus the exact Node 22.11.0 floor on Ubuntu. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`pm-lifecycle` matrix); runner: `scripts/run-lifecycle-test.mjs`.
- **PM-004** — Yarn Classic 1.22.22 runs the same manager-native lifecycle and platform matrix without an npm-runner fallback. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`pm-lifecycle` matrix); runner: `scripts/run-lifecycle-test.mjs`.
- **PM-005** — Bun 1.3.14 runs the same lifecycle and platform matrix through `bunx --no-install`. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`pm-lifecycle` matrix); runner: `scripts/run-lifecycle-test.mjs`.
- **PM-006** — Yarn Berry 4.17.0 is pinned in an integrity-locked CLI fixture and runs the packed package with `nodeLinker: node-modules` on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows at Node 24 plus Ubuntu at the exact Node 22.11.0 floor. The fixture verifies manager-native CLI/bin resolution, root and nested workspaces, all three real Git hooks, clone/doctor repair, linked worktrees, and uninstall. It asserts a real `node_modules` tree and no `.pnp.cjs`; Plug'n'Play remains unsupported. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; runner: `scripts/run-lifecycle-test.mjs`; fixture pin: `test/fixtures/yarn-berry/package-lock.json`.
- **PM-007** — installs with lifecycle scripts disabled leave clone-local hooks absent but keep the local CLI available; explicit `doctor` repair restores exact generated hooks for every manager. A later scripts-enabled reinstall also repairs npm, pnpm, Yarn Classic, and Bun; Berry's documented lifecycle boundary requires explicit `doctor`. CI lifecycle matrix: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; runner: `scripts/ci-lifecycle-smoke.mjs`.
- **PM-008** — package-manager guidance is workspace-aware, the lifecycle strips the outer npm user agent, and pre-commit/uninstall output must name the selected manager. Unit: `test/package-manager.test.mjs`; CI lifecycle matrix: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Monorepos and workspaces

- **MONO-001** — workspace-root behavior across npm, pnpm, Yarn Classic, Yarn Berry `node-modules`, and Bun. The real packed package is installed at the root, each manager's workspace selector runs both package test scripts, root config owns staged checks, and root-native hooks run for commits and pushes. CI lifecycle matrix: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; script: `scripts/ci-lifecycle-smoke.mjs`.
- **MONO-002** — shallow and nested workspace packages are checked together, including when `git commit` starts in the nested package. Package-local `precommitChecks` values remain untouched and do not override the root. CI lifecycle matrix: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; guide: [Monorepo & workspaces](monorepo.md).
- **MONO-003** — linked Git worktrees share hooks through Git's common directory, repair safely during a worktree-local install, and run the root checks from a nested package. CI lifecycle matrix: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### CI/CD and repository automation

- **CI-001** — every tracked workflow has read-only defaults, an explicit
  concurrency policy, bounded runnable jobs, non-persisted checkout credentials,
  and an allowlisted job-permission surface. Unit: `test/ci-policy.test.mjs`;
  semantic validation: actionlint in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **CI-002** — the sole branch-protection context fails unless DCO, static
  quality, dependency audit, every supported runtime/lifecycle lane, and CodeQL
  each report exact success. Unit: `test/ci-policy.test.mjs` and
  `test/test-quality.test.mjs`; CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **CI-003** — CodeQL is reusable by required CI while retaining scheduled and
  manual analysis. Unit: `test/ci-policy.test.mjs`; workflow:
  `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`.
- **CI-004** — release tags serialize through GitHub's maximum 100-run pending
  queue without cancelling in-flight or already-pending publications, generated
  artifact names cross into shell through quoted environment variables, and
  every ordinary action reference is immutable. Unit: `test/ci-policy.test.mjs`
  and `test/release-integrity.test.mjs`.
- **CI-005** — routine npm and Actions releases age for seven days, security
  updates remain immediate, and both required CI and weekly health fail on
  high-severity advisories. Unit: `test/ci-policy.test.mjs`; automation:
  `.github/dependabot.yml` and `.github/workflows/repo-health.yml`.

Explicit non-goals are per-package configuration/tool versions, build-system dependency-graph scheduling, and an exhaustive speculative matrix of custom hoisting layouts. The tested defaults form the support contract; reproducible gaps should add focused fixtures and issues.

## Deferred

- **PERF-003** — many-files performance. Add only after the behavior matrix is stable.

## Manual and production validation

- **PKG-008** — the published npm package installs and exposes the CLI bin.
  Recheck in a clean project before launch with
  `npm install -D commitment-issues@latest` and
  `npx --no-install commitment-issues --help`.
- **LIFE-005** — the complete clean-registry launch path (`init`, advisory
  commit warning, `commit:fix`, and related push-time tests) remains a launch
  gate in issue #78.
- **REL-001** — the production v3.3.2 tag workflow published the exact npm
  tarball and both immutable GitHub Release assets. The npm/GitHub tarballs and
  SLSA subject share one SHA-256; independent npm signature and
  `slsa-verifier` checks passed. See the
  [release-verification baseline](release-verification.md#validated-release-baseline).
- **REL-002** — live history anchors the recovery states without creating a
  test publication: v3.3.0 is an npm-published but immutable zero-asset GitHub
  Release that cannot resume, v3.3.1 failed before npm but required a workflow
  edit, and v3.3.2 is complete. Evidence:
  [release audit](audits/release-packaging-and-upgrades.md#historical-release-and-tag-evidence).
