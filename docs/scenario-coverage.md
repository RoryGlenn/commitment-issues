# Scenario Coverage

This tracker turns the exhaustive scenario list into an implementation plan. Update it whenever a scenario is covered, deferred, or intentionally left manual.

## Status values

- **Covered** — automated coverage exists and is expected to run in CI.
- **Partial** — some coverage exists, but important variants remain.
- **Not covered** — no meaningful automated coverage yet.
- **Manual** — best validated manually for now.
- **Deferred** — intentionally not implemented yet.
- **Not applicable** — out of scope for this package.

### Pre-push modes

- **PUSH-001** — disabled by default: silent and allows during a real push, and explains how to enable a mode when run interactively. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-002** — blocking mode runs only the pushed files' tests and blocks on failure; a pass shows a summary and allows. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-003** — advisory mode runs tests and warns without blocking; a pass shows a summary. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **PUSH-004** — `blockPushOnTestFailure` takes precedence over `advisePushTests`, and the dual-mode conflict is surfaced. Fixture: `test/prepush.test.mjs`.

### Advisory message and tone

- **MSG-001** — a success message renders when there are no issues. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-002** — recommends `commit:fix` when amend is safe; suppressed when worktree changes block amend or it cannot be inspected. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-003** — mixed fixable + manual issues recommend `commit:fix` and flag manual work, including when amend is blocked. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-004** — no fix command is shown when nothing is auto-fixable. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-005** — an issue's detail lines render. Unit: `test/message.test.mjs`.
- **MSG-006** — fun tone renders the "Relationship notes" variant from `precommitChecks.tone`. Subprocess: `test/fun-tone.test.mjs`.

### Internal helpers

- **LIB-001** — ESLint JSON summarizing and manual-issue extraction (totals, fixables, empty/invalid, missing rule id). Unit: `test/checks.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-002** — Prettier list parsing and Node test-summary parsing (TAP/spec, pass-only/fail-only, unrecognized → null). Unit: `test/checks.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-003** — test-exemption and glob logic: `isTestExemptFile`, `testExempt` globs, `globToRegExp`, and file classifiers. Unit: `test/lib-files.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-004** — test discovery and Git-path helpers: `findTestFile`, `collectTestsForFiles`, `parseNameStatusPaths`, and `shortFileList`. Unit: `test/lib-files.test.mjs`.
- **LIB-005** — box rendering: `printBox` and severity boxes color the whole border. Unit: `test/ui.test.mjs`.

### Safety path matrix

- **SEC-001** — paths with spaces are passed as argv and through a staged-file flow. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-002** — paths with quotes are passed safely through argv and staged-file flows. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-003** — paths with semicolons are passed safely through argv and staged-file flows. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-004** — Unicode paths are passed safely through argv and staged-file flows. Unit/subprocess: `test/process.test.mjs`, `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-005** — Windows-style backslash tokens are passed as literal argv. Unit: `test/process.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-006** — glob-like filename characters are passed safely through a staged-file flow. Subprocess: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-007** — Git path output is read with `core.quotePath=false` in key hook flows. Source: `scripts/precommit.mjs`, `scripts/fix-staged.mjs`, `scripts/commit-fix.mjs`, `scripts/prepush.mjs`.
- **SEC-008** — accidentally staged `node_modules` files are skipped by pre-commit checks. Fixture: `test/precommit-dependency-ignore.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-009** — pre-push diff uses NUL-delimited name/status output (plus `core.quotePath=false`), so deletions, renames, Unicode, whitespace, and newlines remain unambiguous for associated-test discovery. Unit/subprocess: `test/lib-files.test.mjs`, `test/prepush.test.mjs`.
- **SEC-010** — staged-secret parsing distinguishes file headers from added hunk content, including source lines beginning with `++ `. Unit/subprocess: `test/secret-scan.test.mjs`, `test/secret-scan-integration.test.mjs`.

### Performance

- **PERF-001** — timeout is enforced. Fixture: precommit / prepush tests.

### User lifecycle

- **LIFE-001** — user installs and immediately commits in a fresh external repo. CI lifecycle smoke: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **LIFE-002** — user installs and immediately pushes to a bare remote from a fresh external repo. CI lifecycle smoke: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **LIFE-003** — advisory-only forever. Fixture/docs: README + prepush tests.
- **LIFE-004** — blocking on push. Fixture/docs: README + prepush tests.
- **LIFE-005** — user installs from npm, runs help, initializes, and runs the pre-commit command with no staged files. Manual: fresh temp project with `commitment-issues@latest`.
- **LIFE-006** — a project-owned `prepare` survives init; after commit/push, a fresh clone's normal install runs the composed repair and recreates both local hooks. CI lifecycle matrix: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; script: `scripts/ci-lifecycle-smoke.mjs`.

### Package managers

- **PM-001** — package-manager detection (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun) via `npm_config_user_agent` and lockfiles, plus package-manager-aware command hints in advisory, `fix:staged`, and `doctor` output. Unit: `test/package-manager.test.mjs`. Subprocess: `test/fix-staged.test.mjs`.
- **PM-002** — uninstall prints a package-removal command for the detected manager. Unit: `test/package-manager.test.mjs`. Fixture: `test/uninstall.test.mjs`.
- **PM-002** — pnpm end-to-end lifecycle smoke (pack → install → init → commit → push). CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (pm-smoke matrix); script: `scripts/ci-lifecycle-smoke.mjs`.
- **PM-003** — yarn classic end-to-end lifecycle smoke. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (pm-smoke matrix); script: `scripts/ci-lifecycle-smoke.mjs`.
- **PM-005** — bun end-to-end lifecycle smoke. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (pm-smoke matrix); script: `scripts/ci-lifecycle-smoke.mjs`.

## Deferred

- **PM-004** — yarn Berry (Plug'n'Play) support. Hooks resolve the bin from `node_modules/.bin`, so Berry projects need `nodeLinker: node-modules`; PnP is not yet supported. Classic yarn is covered by PM-003. A dedicated [Yarn Berry guide](yarn-berry.md) documents the `node-modules` setup and the PnP boundary.
- **MONO-001** — workspace root behavior. Hooks run from the Git root and check staged files across all packages using the root `precommitChecks` config and hoisted tools. Boundary documented in the [Monorepo & workspaces guide](monorepo.md).
- **MONO-002** — nested workspace package behavior. Per-package `precommitChecks` config and per-package tool versions are out of scope; the boundary is documented in the [Monorepo & workspaces guide](monorepo.md).
- **PERF-002** — many-files performance. Add only after the behavior matrix is stable.

## Not covered yet

### Init / install fixture matrix

- Read-only `package.json` / `.gitignore` where practical.
- More custom hook variants if users report specific merge expectations.

### Safety path matrix

- Newlines in filenames, if Git and the platform can create the filename reliably.

### Release and lifecycle

- Release from a tag.
- Release from GitHub Actions.
- Upgrade from older package versions.
- Downgrade behavior.
- Corporate locked-down environment behavior.

## Next batches

### Batch 5: deferred support boundaries

- pnpm / yarn / bun.
- Monorepo root/package fixtures.
- Release-from-tag / release-from-CI workflows.
