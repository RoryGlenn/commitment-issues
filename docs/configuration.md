# Configuration and Behavior

This page covers the deeper behavior behind `commitment-issues`: what `init` changes, how commit and push checks run, how test discovery works, and which options are available.

For the short install path, start with the [README](../README.md). For terminal
output examples, see the repository's
[message-state gallery](https://github.com/RoryGlenn/commitment-issues/blob/main/docs/message-states.md).

## What `init` changes

`npx --no-install commitment-issues init` updates the consuming repo so the installed package can run from Git hooks:

- wires the pre-commit hook to `commitment-issues precommit`
- wires the pre-push hook to `commitment-issues prepush "$@"`
- wires `commitment-issues commit-msg "$1"` only when optional
  commit-message linting is explicitly enabled
- adds npm scripts for `doctor`, `fix:staged`, `commit:fix`, and direct pre-commit checks
- enables advisory push tests in the active configuration source
- migrates pre-3.0 husky-era wiring (retires the old `core.hooksPath`, removes the generated `.husky` files)
- gitignores `.eslintcache`, `.prettiercache`, and `node_modules/`

Nothing is copied into your repo from the package source. The hooks are plain `.git/hooks` files that call the installed `commitment-issues` bin — no hook manager is involved.

### Existing hook-manager mode

`init --integration=husky`, `--integration=lefthook`, and
`--integration=pre-commit` switch hook ownership from native generation to
snippet-first coexistence. In this mode init still manages the package scripts,
advisory push default, and ignore entries above, but it:

- does not write `.git/hooks` or manager files;
- does not unset or replace `core.hooksPath`;
- prints static project-local entries for each inactive pre-commit, pre-push,
  and optional commit-msg hook;
- composes `doctor --quiet --integration=<manager>` into `prepare`, so a later
  install verifies the same owner instead of running native repair; and
- reports lint-staged as composition evidence without changing its tasks.

Bare `--integration` selects automatically only when exactly one supported
owner is evident. No or multiple owners fail before writes. An explicit owner
is honored while other manager evidence is reported, but it does not override
an unsafe selected configuration. Config-file symlinks, duplicate or
unsupported selected configs, directories where files are expected, and
unreadable paths stop init before it changes package files or hooks.

The read-only inspection boundary is intentionally narrow:

| Manager    | Configuration and installed-wrapper boundary                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Husky      | A regular `.husky` directory, its exact active `.husky`/`.husky/_` hook path, exact unconditional entry lines, and a Husky 8.0.1–8.0.3 or 9.0.2–9.1.7 dispatcher/runtime shape                                        |
| Lefthook   | Exactly one main YAML file named `lefthook.yml`, `lefthook.yaml`, `.lefthook.yml`, `.lefthook.yaml`, `.config/lefthook.yml`, or `.config/lefthook.yaml`, plus a canonical Lefthook 2.1.10 or narrow direct dispatcher |
| pre-commit | Exactly one `.pre-commit-config.yaml` or `.pre-commit-config.yml`, plus the supported pre-commit 3.2+ generated dispatcher bound to that same config and hook type                                                    |

Lefthook JSON, JSONC, TOML, local configuration, `extends`/`remotes`, advanced
YAML constructs, unreviewed top-level options (including `min_version`, `rc`,
custom runtime/source settings, and presentation globals), and
`LEFTHOOK_CONFIG` overrides require manual review. So do customized or newer
manager wrapper templates. A restricted hook `PATH` must still provide `node`;
Lefthook and pre-commit must also resolve reviewed Lefthook and Python runtime
identities. Husky uses its inspected repository-local dispatcher rather than a
`husky` executable from `PATH`. Inspection never executes a
repository-controlled probe.

Entry validation is exact. Duplicate Lefthook hook/command keys and duplicate
pre-commit IDs are not healthy. The selected Commitment Issues hook and command
must be unconditional; unrelated manager skip and conditional rules remain
untouched. pre-commit entries must retain the documented `entry`, `language`,
`pass_filenames`, `always_run`, and `stages` values and must not add `args`.
Inspection validates the complete selected document before reporting health:
every Lefthook hook and nested command/script/job must use the audited schema,
and every pre-commit local/meta/remote repo plus supported top-level option must
have an audited language, type-tag, stage, version, and regex form. Unknown or
newer fields remain user-owned but require manual review.
Lefthook snippets remain static: pre-push receives Git's ref stream through
`use_stdin: true`, and the optional commit-msg entry uses `--git-path` to
resolve Git's active message file inside Commitment Issues instead of
interpolating a manager template.

lint-staged detection is composition evidence only. It recognizes package
keys, the documented `.lintstagedrc*` and `lint-staged.config.*` names, and a
top-level `lint-staged` key in `package.yaml` or `package.yml`; it never loads,
executes, or interprets those task configurations.

`core.hooksPath` is read as exactly one NUL-delimited Git record and preserved
exactly; missing or malformed framing fails closed. An explicitly configured
empty value is therefore different from an unset key, and leading or trailing
whitespace remains part of the effective path. POSIX backslashes stay literal;
on Windows only, they are separators just as they are for Git. Only exact
`.husky` or `.husky/_` paths, apart from platform separators at those same
positions and trailing separators, count as Husky-owned paths.

`doctor --integration=<manager>` performs no repairs. It validates both the
manager configuration entry and the executable wrapper in Git's effective
hooks directory; a pasted entry is not called active before the manager has
installed its wrapper. Interactive missing wiring exits 1 and prints either
the exact config snippet or manager install command. For
`.pre-commit-config.yml`, that command includes
`--config .pre-commit-config.yml` before the enabled `--hook-type` values.
Quiet install-time verification warns and exits 0. The complete snippets,
forwarding rules, manager bypass behavior, and uninstall boundary are in
[Keep an existing hook manager](migration.md#keep-an-existing-hook-manager).

Before changing any file, `init` validates that the `package.json` root and any
existing `scripts` and `precommitChecks` values are JSON objects (not `null`,
arrays, or primitive values). An invalid shape exits with the exact property to
fix and leaves `package.json` unchanged.

A custom hook is active only when its guarded local command is first (after an
exact Husky v8 source line). Comments, conditions, examples, and inert or
non-executable files do not count. User-owned hooks stay unchanged: `hook`
keeps skips hook-scoped, and doctor reports missing, old, or duplicate forms.

## Configuration files and precedence

Configuration can live in either of these repository-root files:

1. `.commitmentrc.json`, with options directly at the top level
2. `package.json`, under the existing `precommitChecks` object
3. built-in defaults for options absent from both files

The standalone file is optional. Existing `package.json` configurations behave
exactly as before when it is absent. When both exist, they are shallowly merged
one key at a time and `.commitmentrc.json` wins. Arrays are replaced, not
concatenated. For example:

```json
{
  "requireTests": false,
  "testExempt": ["generated/**"],
  "tone": "fun"
}
```

Only JSON is supported; JavaScript configuration is deliberately not loaded or
executed. The top-level value must be an object. A recognized but invalid
standalone value still owns its higher-precedence key and is omitted in favor
of the built-in default—it does not silently revive the lower-precedence
`package.json` value.

If the standalone file cannot be parsed or has a non-object root, pre-commit and
pre-push print an advisory warning and fall back to `package.json` or defaults.
`doctor` reports the same problem without breaking `doctor --quiet` during an
install. Mutating commands are stricter: `init` and `uninstall` stop before any
write until the file is fixed or removed.

Hook-time readers also warn when `package.json` cannot be read, contains invalid
JSON, has a non-object root, or provides a non-object `precommitChecks` value.
Valid `.commitmentrc.json` settings remain active; otherwise the hooks use safe
defaults so the malformed manifest can still be repaired in a commit. The
fallback never happens silently.

`init` keeps its backward-compatible default of creating `precommitChecks` in
`package.json`. If `.commitmentrc.json` already exists, it instead adds the
default `advisePushTests` setting there when neither push mode is configured.
Every setup decision, including whether to wire the optional `commit-msg` hook,
uses the merged effective configuration and the same standalone precedence as
the runtime hooks.
`uninstall --dry-run` previews removal of a valid standalone file, and
`uninstall` removes it with the rest of the package-specific configuration.

The examples below use the `package.json` form. The same keys can be moved to
the top level of `.commitmentrc.json` without the `precommitChecks` wrapper.

## Hook output policy

Routine hooks default to `"problems-only"`: `precommit`, `prepush`, and
`commit-msg` suppress final `success` and `info` boxes while continuing to run
every configured check. Warnings and errors always remain visible, and a mixed
result is governed by its strongest final severity. For example, passing tests
plus a protected-branch warning still render together as one warning box.

To restore continuous confirmation, opt into normal output:

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "hookOutput": "normal"
  }
}
```

The equivalent standalone setting is `{ "hookOutput": "normal" }`.
`hookOutput` changes presentation only: check execution, blocking decisions,
exit codes, configuration diagnostics, and `--json` payloads are unchanged.
It does not apply to operational commands such as `init`, `uninstall`,
`doctor`, `commit-fix`, or `fix-staged`. Use `COMMITMENT_ISSUES=0` when the
entire hook should be bypassed instead.

The once-per-clone pre-commit welcome is intentionally outside
`hookOutput`: it remains visible with the default `"problems-only"` policy.
Projects that require completely silent successful hooks can disable that
onboarding message independently. A warning or error takes priority over the
welcome and leaves it available for a later clean invocation.

## First-commit welcome

The first eligible clean or informational human-readable pre-commit run in a
clone shows a compact Commit Owl welcome as its one final presentation. It
explains that `commitment-issues` is active and asks contributors to report
confusing hook guidance. The hook verification and repair hint uses the
detected package manager, such as
`Verify or repair the hooks anytime: pnpm run doctor` in a pnpm project.

Warnings and errors always take priority. They render without the welcome and
without creating its marker, so the contributor can still receive onboarding
on a later clean invocation and no command emits two boxes.

After displaying the message, the hook creates the versioned marker
`<git-common-dir>/commitment-issues/welcome-v1`. Keeping it below Git's common
directory leaves the working tree untouched and makes linked worktrees share
one welcome. Existing clones may see the message once after upgrading.

To opt out without changing any checks or enforcement behavior:

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "showWelcomeOnFirstCommit": false
  }
}
```

JSON mode never displays or consumes the welcome. Marker inspection and write
failures are ignored so onboarding can never block a commit.

## Local peer-tool resolution

Built-in ESLint and Prettier checks resolve the package `bin` only from the
repository's reachable `node_modules` tree. There is no implicit `npx`
fallback. When a peer is missing, commit-time checks report an advisory and the
package-manager-specific install command; fix commands fail nonzero rather than
claiming an incomplete fix succeeded. `doctor` reports the same local state.

This restriction does not replace the executable or configured options in
explicit configuration. A command such as `["npx", "vitest", "run"]`
deliberately opts into npx's own resolution and network behavior. The hook
appends discovered test paths as arguments. For Node's built-in `--test`
runner, those paths are placed after `--`; a leading-hyphen relative path is
made absolute so Node cannot interpret a repository filename as an option.

## What happens on commit and push?

| Action         | Default behavior                                                                                        | Stricter option                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git commit`   | Reports lint, formatting, missing-test, test, branch, and commit-shape issues; debug scanning is opt-in | Enable `runStagedTests` to run staged-related tests            |
| `git push`     | Runs pushed-file tests in advisory mode after `init`; warns when pushing a protected branch             | Enable `blockPushOnTestFailure` to stop pushes on test failure |
| commit message | No check until `commitMessage.enabled` is true; then warns on commitlint failures                       | Set `commitMessage.blockOnFailure` to stop the commit          |

## Active flow

- The pre-commit hook runs `commitment-issues precommit`.
- Its first eligible clean or informational human-readable run shows the
  default-on, once-per-clone welcome as the final box;
  `showWelcomeOnFirstCommit: false` opts out.
- `scripts/precommit.mjs` inspects staged files and prints one consolidated summary box.
- The pre-push hook runs `commitment-issues prepush "$@"` so Git's remote
  arguments reach first-push base selection.
- `scripts/prepush.mjs` runs tests associated with pushed files in advisory mode by default.
- An enabled commit-msg hook passes Git's message file as one quoted argument to
  `commitment-issues commit-msg`; it stays silent when commitlint succeeds.
- `blockPushOnTestFailure` turns pushed-file test failures into a hard gate.
- When automatic fixes can still be applied safely after a commit, the hook suggests `npm run commit:fix`.
- `npm run fix:staged` applies staged-only ESLint and Prettier fixes directly and restages the result.
- `npm run commit:fix` applies automatic fixes to the latest clean commit and amends it in place.

## TypeScript and mixed projects

- Staged `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`, and `.cjs` files are treated as code files alongside `.js`, `.jsx`, and `.mjs`.
- `.d.ts` declaration files are excluded from the missing-test check.
- The unit-test heuristic recognizes matching tests in the same directory, an adjacent `__tests__/`, or a top-level `test/` / `tests/` directory.
- These scripts delegate linting to your project's own ESLint config. Real TypeScript projects need a TypeScript-aware ESLint parser/config.

## Unit-test heuristics

The hook flags staged code files that have no matching test, but it skips files that do not normally need one:

- test files themselves (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`) and anything under `test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, or `__mocks__/`
- config files (`*.config.*` and dotfile configs like `.eslintrc.cjs`)
- type declarations (`*.d.ts`, `.d.mts`, `.d.cts`)
- Storybook stories (`*.stories.*`)
- generated code (`*.generated.*`, or files under `generated/` / `__generated__/`)

A matching test is found when it sits next to the file, in an adjacent `__tests__/`, or in a top-level `test/` / `tests/` directory. For example, `src/foo.ts` is satisfied by `test/foo.test.ts`.

To exempt additional paths, add glob patterns under `precommitChecks.testExempt` in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "testExempt": ["src/legacy/**", "**/*.pb.ts"]
  }
}
```

## Running staged tests at commit time

By default the commit hook only checks for missing tests; it does not run them. To also run the tests relevant to a commit, enable it in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "runStagedTests": true,
    "testCommand": ["node", "--test"]
  }
}
```

When enabled, the hook runs `testCommand` against the staged test files plus the tests it can find for staged source files. `testCommand` is optional and defaults to `node --test`.

> Enabling `runStagedTests` executes a repo-defined command on every commit, similar to `lint-staged`. Only enable it in repositories you trust. Spawned tools are capped by a timeout so a hung command cannot wedge a commit.

### Timeout cleanup boundary

Timed commands run in a dedicated process group on Ubuntu/macOS. When the
deadline expires, the whole attached group is force-terminated. Windows uses
the built-in `taskkill /t /f` process-tree operation, with a direct-child kill
as a fallback if tree termination is unavailable. The hook reports a timeout
separately from a spawn failure, external signal, normal nonzero exit, or
success.

Cleanup covers descendants that remain attached to the command's process group
or Windows process tree. A descendant that deliberately daemonizes, reparents,
or creates a separate process group can escape that boundary; the operating
system does not expose one portable, permission-free way to reclaim such a
process. Commands used in hooks should not launch background daemons.

### Using a different test runner

`testCommand` can be any command that accepts test file paths as arguments.
Both the staged-test check and the push gate append the relevant test files to
it. Custom runners receive the configured argv followed by those paths. Node
`--test` commands receive discovered paths after an option separator, with
leading-hyphen paths made absolute. Test commands inherit the normal developer
environment except for Git's repository-local routing variables (`GIT_DIR`,
`GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, and related values). Removing those hook
variables lets tests rediscover the current checkout by working directory and
prevents nested Git fixtures from targeting the hook caller.

**Vitest:**

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "testCommand": ["npx", "vitest", "run"]
  }
}
```

The `run` subcommand is required. Without it, Vitest starts watch mode and the hook will hang.

**Jest:**

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "testCommand": ["npx", "jest"]
  }
}
```

If your tests rely on a runner's globals, running them under the default `node --test` can fail with `ReferenceError: test is not defined`. Set `testCommand` to your actual runner.

## Advisory push tests

`init` enables `advisePushTests` by default. On `git push`, the pre-push hook runs only the tests associated with the files being pushed: the changed test files themselves, plus any test discovered for a changed source file.

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "advisePushTests": true,
    "testCommand": ["node", "--test"]
  }
}
```

Failures show a `Tests failed (advisory)` warning box, but the push still proceeds. If the pushed files have no associated tests, the push is allowed. The runner is `testCommand`, which defaults to `node --test` and must accept test file paths as arguments.

## Blocking pushes on test failure

Use push-time blocking when you want a hard gate before code is shared. Enable it in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "blockPushOnTestFailure": true,
    "testCommand": ["node", "--test"]
  }
}
```

When enabled, the same pushed-files test run blocks the push if any tests fail. If `blockPushOnTestFailure` and `advisePushTests` are both set, blocking takes precedence.

The gate is capped by a timeout.

## Commit and push guards

Beyond tool checks, the hooks run instant, git-only advisory guards. All of them join the same consolidated suggestions box, never block by default, and skip themselves silently if git cannot answer:

- **Protected branches** — committing to or pushing a branch matching `protectedBranches` (names or globs, default `["main", "master"]`) prints an advisory. Opt into hard blocking with `blockProtectedBranches: true`; bypass a block once with `--no-verify`. Set `protectedBranches: []` to disable entirely (e.g. trunk-based repos).
- **Behind upstream** — committing while the branch is behind its upstream (as of the last fetch) suggests pulling or rebasing first. Disable with `adviseBehindUpstream: false`.
- **Commit size** — commits staging more than `maxCommitFiles` files (default 30) or `maxCommitLines` changed lines (default 2000) get a split-it-up nudge. Set either to `0` to disable.
- **Large files** — staged files over `maxFileSizeMb` (default 5) are listed with a Git LFS pointer. Set to `0` to disable.
- **Generated files** — staged paths matching `generatedPaths` (default: `dist`, `build`, `coverage`, `node_modules`, `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__` anywhere in the tree) are flagged as usually-ignored artifacts. Setting `generatedPaths` replaces the default list.
- **Staged secrets** — lines _added_ by the staged diff are scanned against a curated, high-precision credential set (AWS access keys, private-key headers, GitHub/Slack/npm/Stripe live/Google API tokens, URLs with embedded passwords), and staged dotenv files are flagged (`.env.example`/`.env.sample`/`.env.template` are ignored). Known documentation examples and placeholder passwords (`${DB_PASS}`, `<password>`, `changeme`…) never fire. Opt into hard blocking with `blockOnSecrets: true`; exempt fixture paths with `secretExempt` globs; disable with `scanSecrets: false`. Advisory mode warns and allows the commit if Git cannot produce a valid staged patch. Blocking mode fails closed on a Git launch failure, nonzero result, or malformed patch because possible secrets could not be ruled out. Human and JSON output distinguish an unavailable scan from a detected secret and show `git commit --no-verify` as the one-time bypass. A secret that reached a commit should be rotated even if the commit is stopped.
- **Temporary debug artifacts** — disabled until `scanDebugArtifacts: true`.
  The enabled check scans only added staged lines, reports one aggregate
  advisory with file, line, and rule names, and never blocks. It shares the
  staged-patch parser and Git invocation with secret scanning.

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "protectedBranches": ["main", "release/*"],
    "blockProtectedBranches": true,
    "maxCommitFiles": 20,
    "maxFileSizeMb": 2
  }
}
```

## Optional temporary debug-artifact advisory

Enable the check after the team has reviewed its deliberately narrow rule set:

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "scanDebugArtifacts": true,
    "debugArtifactExempt": [
      "docs/**",
      "test/fixtures/**",
      "dist/**",
      "src/intentional-console/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

The supported rules and stable JSON rule IDs are:

| Rule ID                   | High-precision added-line form                 | Files                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `javascript.console-log`  | A complete stand-alone `console.log(...)` call | JS module/script family (`.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.tsx`) |
| `javascript.debugger`     | A complete stand-alone `debugger` statement    | JS module/script family (`.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.tsx`) |
| `python.print`            | A complete stand-alone `print(...)` call       | Python                                                                                 |
| `python.pdb-set-trace`    | A complete stand-alone `pdb.set_trace()` call  | Python                                                                                 |
| `ruby.binding-pry`        | A complete stand-alone `binding.pry` call      | Ruby and Rakefiles                                                                     |
| `comment.todo-remove`     | A comment-only `TODO … remove` marker          | Files above                                                                            |
| `comment.fixme-temporary` | A comment-only `FIXME … temporary` marker      | Files above                                                                            |

False-positive policy is conservative at the physical-line level: executable
rules must occupy one whole added line (apart from indentation, a terminator,
or trailing comment), and they are limited to the language shown. Same-line
quoted examples, prose, comment-prefixed statements, inline comments after
code, unsupported file types, removed lines, and unchanged context do not
match. The zero-context patch does not contain enough lexical state to prove
whether a stand-alone-looking line is inside a multiline block comment,
JavaScript template string, Python triple-quoted string, or similar construct,
so those lines can still produce an advisory. `TODO remove` and `FIXME
temporary` are the only intentional comment rules because the wording itself
declares temporary work. This favors missing unusual debug syntax over noisy
warnings without claiming language-parser precision. Legitimate CLI output,
committed debugging tools, and multiline source examples should use a path
exemption.

When `debugArtifactExempt` is omitted, the built-in list excludes `docs` plus
fixture and snapshot directories/files, and composes those entries with the
effective `generatedPaths` list. That means a repository which replaces the
generated-file defaults also exempts its replacement paths here. Supplying
`debugArtifactExempt` **replaces** the complete composed list. Include any
defaults the repository wants to retain; an explicit empty list scans supported
files in those locations. Globs are deterministic repository-relative paths,
not regular expressions or shell commands.

A Git launch failure, nonzero result, or malformed staged patch produces the
separate `debug-artifacts.unavailable` advisory and still exits `0`. Detected
artifacts use `debug-artifacts.detected`. Human output aggregates every match
and all other checks into the command's one final box. JSON uses the stable
`debug-artifacts` check ID, exposes the applicable subtype as
`checks[].details.findingId`, and publishes structured `file`, `line`, `ruleId`,
and `label` entries in the same extensible details object.

## Optional commit-message linting

Commit-message linting is disabled by default and uses the consumer's own
[commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) installation and configuration. The
package does not add commitlint as a dependency or supply a built-in
Conventional Commits ruleset.

1. Install the CLI and whichever rules package your project chooses. For
   example:

   ```bash
   npm install -D @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
   ```

2. Add a consumer-owned commitlint config. This example is optional; any
   commitlint-supported config with at least one rule is valid:

   ```js
   // commitlint.config.js
   export default { extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"] };
   ```

3. Enable the advisory integration:

   ```json
   {
     "precommitChecks": {
       "commitMessage": {
         "enabled": true,
         "blockOnFailure": false
       }
     }
   }
   ```

The generated `.git/hooks/commit-msg` body invokes
`commitment-issues commit-msg "$1"`, preserving the message-file path as one
literal argument. If a custom commit-msg hook already exists, `init` and
`doctor` leave it unchanged and show that exact command for manual composition.
Git's `git commit --no-verify` bypasses the hook in the standard way.
Lefthook coexistence uses the separate static `hook commit-msg --git-path` form;
Commitment Issues then resolves this worktree's `MERGE_MSG` during a direct
automatic merge and `COMMIT_EDITMSG` otherwise before passing one absolute argv
value to commitlint.

Resolution is intentionally local-only: the runner walks upward for
`node_modules/.bin/commitlint`, passes its absolute path and literal argv through
the cross-platform process helper, and never falls back to `npx`, a global
binary, or the network. Yarn Plug'n'Play is
therefore outside this integration's boundary, matching the package's existing
`node_modules` requirement.

| Nested key       | Type    | Default | Description                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`        | boolean | `false` | Create/repair the commit-msg hook and run project-local commitlint. |
| `blockOnFailure` | boolean | `false` | Block on lint, setup, missing-config, or unavailable-tool failures. |

`blockOnFailure` never implies enablement; setting it alone produces a
configuration warning and leaves commit-message linting disabled.

In advisory mode, a lint finding, missing local CLI, missing commitlint config,
unreadable message file, timeout, or launch failure prints a warning and allows
the commit. With `blockOnFailure: true`, the same outcomes exit non-zero. The
runner recognizes both commitlint's missing-config result code and the
strict-mode `empty-rules` diagnostic. It uses `--strict` so warning-level rules
are surfaced instead of disappearing behind exit code 0.
A successful run is silent. `doctor` also warns when
the feature is enabled but the project-local CLI is absent, while still exiting
successfully from install-time `doctor --quiet`.

## Configuration reference

All options are optional and use the same types in either configuration file:

Unrecognized configuration keys, including nested `commitMessage` keys, are ignored and named with their effective source in diagnostics from hooks, `init`, and `doctor` — so typos like `requireTest` or `commitMessage.enable` cannot silently disable, enable, or enforce a check.

Recognized keys with the wrong value type (for example a string where a boolean is expected, or an out-of-range `timeoutMs`) are likewise ignored and fall back to their defaults, and the hooks print a one-line warning naming each invalid value — so a mistyped value cannot silently change behavior either. Both warnings are advisory only: the commit or push still proceeds.

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "testExempt": ["src/legacy/**"],
    "runStagedTests": true,
    "blockPushOnTestFailure": true,
    "testCommand": ["node", "--test"]
  }
}
```

## Project structure

- `scripts/cli.mjs` — the `commitment-issues` bin; dispatches subcommands: `init`, `doctor`, `precommit`, `prepush`, `commit-msg`, `commit-fix`, `fix-staged`, and `fix-staged-js`.
- `scripts/precommit.mjs` — the pre-commit hook entrypoint.
- `scripts/commit-msg.mjs` — the optional advisory-or-blocking commitlint entrypoint.
- `scripts/init.mjs` — one-command setup for a consuming repo.
- `scripts/prepush.mjs` — the advisory-by-default pre-push test runner; can become a blocking gate through configuration.
- `scripts/doctor.mjs` — verifies and repairs the hook wiring.
- `scripts/fix-staged.mjs` — applies staged-only ESLint/Prettier fixes and restages the result.
- `scripts/fix-staged-js.mjs` — file-list fixer task: ESLint fix followed by Prettier write.
- `scripts/commit-fix.mjs` — applies automatic fixes to the latest clean commit and amends it in place.
- `scripts/lib/` — shared helpers for UI, spawning, file heuristics, output parsing, advisory messages, and config loading.

## Continuous integration

Set `COMMITMENT_ISSUES=0` in CI when package installation might trigger Git
hooks. The variable skips automatic hook dispatch only; explicit CI commands
such as `npm run test:precommit` still execute their checks.

Repository CI covers Node 22.11.0 and 24 on Linux, macOS, and Windows, enforces
100% runtime coverage, and tests packed package-manager lifecycles. See the
[compatibility matrix](compatibility.md) and [coverage policy](branch-coverage.md).

For ready-to-use pipelines, see the [CI provider recipes](ci-recipes.md) for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and CircleCI.
