# Security, Secrets, Paths, and Subprocesses Audit

This is the completion report for
[audit workstream #131](https://github.com/RoryGlenn/commitment-issues/issues/131).
It reviews the implementation at baseline
[`73def8fbb07b30604b36122abbb74200d781bf97`](https://github.com/RoryGlenn/commitment-issues/commit/73def8fbb07b30604b36122abbb74200d781bf97)
plus the fixes recorded in this report. The scope includes secrets handling,
path parsing, subprocess construction and cleanup, local file operations,
dependency state, and every GitHub Actions workflow.

## Executive summary

The audit found five implementation weaknesses and fixed each with adversarial
regression coverage:

1. Opt-in secret enforcement failed open when the staged diff command failed.
   `blockOnSecrets: true` now blocks on a spawn failure, nonzero Git result, or
   malformed patch, while advisory mode continues with an explicit warning.
2. A discovered Node test path beginning with `-` could be interpreted as a
   Node option instead of a file. Node test invocations now place paths behind
   `--` and make leading-hyphen paths absolute.
3. Hook inspection followed symbolic links. A dangling hook link could look
   absent, and repair could write through it. Hook files and hook directories
   are now classified with `lstat`; symlinks are preserved as uninspectable and
   never repaired automatically.
4. Pre-push test reporting used a predictable shared-temporary filename. It now
   creates a private randomized temporary directory and removes that directory
   after reading the report.
5. Git's repository-local hook environment reached test subprocesses. A test
   that created a temporary Git repository could instead reconfigure, commit
   to, or push from the hook caller. Hook-launched tests and the repository's
   fixture helper now remove those routing variables before spawning.

No dependency vulnerability was reported by the lockfile-defined audit. The
High integrity finding tracked by #159 was confirmed end to end and remediated
in this branch; its regression proves that the caller's ref and shared config
remain unchanged. No Critical finding or other new unresolved High finding was
found. The known High release-policy finding in #94 remains open and is
assigned to release audit #136; this audit does not lower or close it. The
historical-review assurance gap in #99 likewise remains open until the core,
security, and release findings have all settled.

The local machine, Git, Node.js, npm, and GitHub platform are trusted computing
base components. A malicious repository can already execute code through its
chosen test runner or other installed project tools; this package does not try
to sandbox that code. It does ensure that filenames and Git output do not
silently become additional command options or shell source.

## Subprocess inventory

Every production or maintainer subprocess source was inspected. The common
runtime rule is `shell: false` by construction: commands and arguments are
separate arrays, and long-running children have a configured timeout.

Existence checks, path joins, and reads inherit the same dispositions as their
owning row. No runtime path is opened through a shell, and no runtime operation
uses repository filenames to select an arbitrary cleanup root.

## Secret-scanner contract

The scanner is deliberately high precision. It examines only lines added by
`git diff --cached -U0` plus staged dotenv filenames. The patch parser validates
file boundaries and hunk old/new counts, decodes Git's C-style pathname quoting,
and handles binary changes, renames, deletions, missing final newlines, and
large patches without confusing metadata for content.

The policy outcomes are distinct:

- advisory mode warns and allows the commit if Git cannot produce a valid
  staged patch;
- `blockOnSecrets: true` blocks when a likely secret is found;
- `blockOnSecrets: true` also blocks when Git fails to launch, exits nonzero,
  or returns malformed patch structure;
- terminal and JSON output identify an unavailable scan separately from a
  detected secret and show `git commit --no-verify` as the explicit one-time
  bypass.

The scanner is not a general-purpose data-loss-prevention engine. It does not
perform entropy scoring, decode base64, or combine multiline values. Teams that
need broader enforcement should add a dedicated server-side scanner and rotate
any credential that reached Git history.

## Dependency and workflow review

`npm ci` resolved the lockfile to 268 dependencies (26 production and 243
development entries in npm's summary) and reported zero install-time
vulnerabilities. `npm audit --json` reported zero vulnerabilities at every
severity. Optional commitlint remains consumer-owned and is not added to this
dependency graph.

All normal third-party workflow actions are pinned to complete commit SHAs.
The SLSA reusable workflow reference in `publish.yml` uses `@v2.1.0`; this is
the intentional reusable-workflow reference required by that upstream SLSA
integration rather than an unnoticed pin exception. Workflows declare explicit
permissions. Security, release, and rendering checkouts set
`persist-credentials: false`; ordinary CI has read-only repository permission.
The demo renderer downloads version-pinned binaries and verifies their SHA-256
digests before execution.

Pull-request workflows do not receive npm release authority. Publication uses
npm OIDC trusted publishing, packs and hashes one exact tarball, generates SLSA
provenance for that artifact, and makes the GitHub Release immutable after its
assets are attached. The remaining tag-to-`main` authorization gap is #94 and
belongs to #136. The scheduled `npm audit --audit-level=high` health job is
reporting-only (`continue-on-error`); locked installation, lint, tests,
coverage, and lifecycle checks remain enforced elsewhere in CI.

## Verification record

The completion branch must produce the following results from a clean
lockfile-defined dependency tree before the final signed commit:

| Command                                      | Result                                                                                             |

## Residual risks and follow-up ownership

- Repository-configured local tools run with the developer's permissions and
  can intentionally consume CPU, memory, files, or the network. That code is
  inside the repository trust boundary, not a sandboxed plugin boundary.
- Async process output is captured in memory until completion or timeout. A
  malicious configured executable can create memory pressure; the same
  executable already has arbitrary local-code authority. A future streaming or
  output-cap design may reduce accidental resource usage.
- `PATH` and the inherited environment are trusted local execution context.
  Built-in peer tools are resolved by absolute local package path. Git plumbing
  intentionally uses the caller's full environment; configured test commands
  inherit ordinary values but not repository-local Git routing.
- The high-precision secrets rules trade recall for low false-positive rates.
  Server-side secret scanning and credential rotation remain necessary defense
  in depth.
- Release tag reachability (#94) remains High/open for #136. The historical
  assurance refresh (#99) remains open until the release audit and its findings
  are complete.

## Conclusion

Audit 2 is complete when the verification table is filled with passing results
and the signed pull request containing this report is linked from #131. Every
subprocess and file-operation group has an explicit boundary and disposition,
the five confirmed implementation weaknesses are fixed with adversarial
regressions, and unresolved release/assurance work remains visible under its
own issue and downstream audit owner.
