# Runtime Coverage Policy

The README badge reports **branch coverage for the user-facing
`commitment-issues` runtime**, not every JavaScript file in the repository.
Run the canonical measurement with:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

The command uses Node's built-in test coverage on both supported Node lines and
requires **100% line, branch, and function coverage**. It passes every source
file explicitly, writes a temporary LCOV report, and fails if any intended
runtime source is missing from that report. The README badge displays the
aggregate branch metric for the same source and test scope.

## Source scope

Every `scripts/**/*.mjs` file enters the public-runtime denominator
automatically unless it appears in the exact maintenance-only list below.
`package.json` separately allowlists every runtime module by path, and a package
regression requires that list to equal the measured runtime set. This keeps both
boundaries closed by default: a new hook, command, or runtime helper cannot
silently escape coverage or enter the tarball accidentally.

These repository-only maintenance files are neither published nor included in
the runtime percentage:

```text
scripts/ci-lifecycle-smoke.mjs
scripts/lib/coverage-badge.mjs
scripts/lib/lifecycle-managers.mjs
scripts/run-branch-coverage.mjs
scripts/run-lifecycle-test.mjs
scripts/update-readme-coverage-badge.mjs
```

They still have unit or integration tests. Static invariants require every
script to be classified exactly once, every runtime script and relative import
to be packed, every maintenance script to be absent, and the public bin target
to exist. New runtime files are therefore covered but not shipped until the
allowlist is reviewed; adding a maintenance-only script requires an explicit
exclusion.

## Test scope

The percentage is driven by every top-level test matching these non-recursive
patterns:

```text
test/*.test.mjs
test/*.test.js
```

Test files and `test/helpers/**` drive execution but are not source files in the
percentage denominator.

The nested `test/integration/lifecycle-manager.test.mjs` suite is reported as a
separate **package lifecycle integration** pass/fail gate. It installs and runs
an unpacked package copy in a temporary repository; mixing those duplicate,
temporary source paths into the source-tree percentage would make the badge
less reproducible rather than more complete. CI runs the npm lifecycle gate in
the Node/OS matrix and separate pnpm, Yarn Classic, Yarn Berry `node-modules`,
and Bun lifecycle gates.

## Runtime behavior ownership

Coverage is not treated as proof by itself. This map assigns every measured
runtime module to the test file that owns its behavior. The executable
invariant in `test/test-quality.test.mjs` fails if a runtime source is missing,
an owner disappears, or no named owner references its source. The finer-grained
claim-to-scenario map remains in
[Scenario Coverage](https://github.com/RoryGlenn/commitment-issues/blob/main/docs/scenario-coverage.md).

| `scripts/run-branch-coverage.mjs`          | the coverage runner itself                                      | `npm run test:coverage`; contract checks in `test/metadata.test.mjs`      |

## Suppressions and meaningful-coverage rules

There are exactly two `node:coverage` suppressions: the fallback error boxes
after mutation preflight in `scripts/init.mjs` and `scripts/uninstall.mjs`.
Permission and identity preflight, replacement races, open-descriptor
comparison, and exclusive creation are exercised deterministically. The
remaining post-preflight operating-system write failure is nondeterministic.
An executable inventory prevents new or enlarged suppressions from being added
silently.

The test strategy also enforces behavior that a percentage cannot:

- pushed-range selection blocks when a source is deleted, when a source is
  renamed but its old test remains, and when source and test are renamed
  together and the renamed test fails;
- generated message-state SVGs are regenerated in a private temporary
  directory and compared byte-for-byte with all 64 committed assets;
- the aggregate `CI Success` job accepts only explicit success from DCO, the
  full OS/Node test and npm lifecycle graph, and the non-npm package-manager
  lifecycle matrix across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows (plus exact-minimum-Node
  manager lanes); every complementary Windows test shard and the parallel npm
  lifecycle lanes must succeed;
- property tests exercise path normalization and ownership invariants, while
  real disposable Git repositories cover CLI and hook behavior;
- no snapshot update can mask behavior: assertions target exact structured
  values, exit statuses, filesystem/Git state, or narrowly normalized visual
  properties.

## CI and badge freshness

Ubuntu CI enforces 100% lines, branches, and functions on Node 22.11.0 and Node 24. Node 24 is the canonical badge producer: `npm run coverage:check` runs the
same gated command and fails if the committed README badge differs from the
generated value.

Windows runs the same top-level test-file set through complementary native Node
shards `1/2` and `2/2` on both Node lines. Their union assigns every test file
exactly once, while the packed npm lifecycle remains a separate parallel
required job. The two Ubuntu coverage lanes stay complete and unsharded, so
the Windows scheduling change does not alter either coverage denominator or
the badge-freshness gate.

The badge rounds to one decimal place, while all three CI thresholds evaluate
Node's unrounded coverage result. Rounding therefore never relaxes the 100%
gate.

To refresh it locally:

```bash
npm run coverage:badge
```

Badge colors are derived from the percentage: `brightgreen` at 90%+, `green`
at 80%+, `yellowgreen` at 70%+, `yellow` at 60%+, `orange` at 50%+, and `red`
below 50%.
