# Repository agent instructions

These instructions apply to the entire repository. Keep changes focused and use
the repository's more detailed guidance instead of inventing a parallel
workflow.

## Start with the authoritative guidance

- Read [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) and
  [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before changing code.
- Use [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) to find the canonical document for a
  product fact. Update the canonical source rather than duplicating a complete
  reference elsewhere.
- Check [`docs/definition-of-done.md`](docs/definition-of-done.md) for the
  applicable change, release, promotion, or maintenance gate.
- Read the matching repository skill before starting specialized work:

  | Work                                                                                       | Required repository guidance                                                                   |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

  | Tests, coverage, temp repositories, or CI-only failures                                    | [`.github/skills/testing-and-coverage/SKILL.md`](.github/skills/testing-and-coverage/SKILL.md) |

## Preserve the product promise

- Keep behavior advisory by default. Blocking requires an explicit
  `precommitChecks` opt-in.
- Preserve user work and Git history. Setup, repair, staged-fix, amend, and
  uninstall flows must refuse ambiguous mutation rather than guess.
- Keep the product local and telemetry-free. Do not upload repository content
  or add implicit network resolution.
- Do not reintroduce Husky or lint-staged. Native `.git/hooks` wiring and the
  staged-fix pipeline are intentional architecture.
- Keep commitlint optional and project-local through `localToolInvocation`.
  Never fall back to `npx`, a global binary, the network, or an invented
  consumer ruleset.

## Runtime and implementation conventions

- The project is pure ESM with no build or transpilation step and supports Node
  `>=22.11.0`. Runtime and command files use `.mjs`.
- Keep `scripts/*.mjs` entrypoints thin; move reusable, unit-testable behavior
  into `scripts/lib/*.mjs`.
- Use the shared process, config, file, message, UI, and package-manager helpers
  instead of duplicating them. Runtime commands should use the `cross-spawn`
  wrappers and argument arrays, not shell interpolation or `shell: true`.
- Keep behavior cross-platform. Normalize path separators before matching,
  parse Git paths with `-c core.quotePath=false`, and do not assume a POSIX
  shell, executable lookup, permission model, or line ending.
- Read configuration only through `scripts/lib/config.mjs`. When a supported
  key changes, keep `KNOWN_PRECOMMIT_CONFIG_KEYS`, `docs/configuration.md`,
  `docs/external-interface.md`, the authoring skill, and tests consistent.
- Standard-tone messages are canonical. Add the corresponding fun-tone variant
  and tests when user-facing wording changes.
- Preserve LF line endings and the existing copyright/SPDX header pattern in
  new source, test, tool, and shell-fixture files.

## Testing and validation

- Install the locked dependency graph with `npm ci`.
- Before every pull request, run:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run format:check
  npm test
  ```

- Run a focused test during iteration with
  `node --test test/<name>.test.mjs`, but run the full baseline before pushing.
- Add tests for every behavior change and a practical regression test for every
  bug fix. Test pure helpers in process and entry scripts through subprocesses
  in disposable Git repositories.
- Published runtime changes must pass `npm run test:coverage`; the gate is 100%
  for lines, branches, and functions on both supported Node lines.
- Run change-specific gates when applicable:
  - package/install/init/doctor/hook/uninstall changes:
    `npm run test:lifecycle:npm`;
  - shell or hook-launch changes: the relevant native
    `npm run test:shell-compat` target and hosted CI;
  - hook traversal, argv, discovery, or output-volume changes:
    `npm run benchmark:hooks -- --tier large --enforce-budgets` on a controlled
    host.
- Do not replace the `scripts/` and `node_modules/` symlinks created by
  `test/helpers/temp-repo.mjs`; subprocess coverage depends on their realpaths.
- Keep test subprocesses hermetic by stripping inherited `COMMITMENT_ISSUES`
  and legacy `HUSKY`. Reproduce CI-only failures with
  `COMMITMENT_ISSUES=0 npm test`.
- Keep `test/property.test.js` as `.js`; the OpenSSF fuzzing check depends on
  that filename pattern.

## Documentation, packaging, and generated assets

- Record every user-visible change under `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## [Unreleased]`
  section and update the relevant canonical documentation, examples, schemas,
  and public-interface references.
- `package.json` uses an exact file allowlist. Classify every new `scripts/`
  module as published runtime or repository-only maintenance, update the
  corresponding coverage/package invariants, and never restore a directory-wide
  `scripts/` allowlist.
- The package has no dependency install lifecycle (`preinstall`, `install`,
  `postinstall`, or `prepare`). Do not add one. Public bin targets must remain
  executable.
- Relative links in shipped Markdown must resolve inside the exact npm tarball.
  Use canonical GitHub URLs when shipped docs reference repository-only
  evidence. Inspect boundary changes with
  `npm pack --dry-run --json --ignore-scripts`.
- Do not hand-edit generated message-state SVGs. Update their source and run
  `npm run states:assets`, then verify with `npm run states` and
  `npm run states:assets:check`.
- Refresh the coverage badge with `npm run coverage:badge`; CI verifies it with
  `npm run coverage:check`.
- `assets/demo.gif` is rendered from `promo/demo.tape`. Review the rendered
  workflow artifact and explain visual changes; do not lower comparison
  thresholds to accept unexplained drift.

## Commits and pull requests

- Use one focused branch and one logical pull request per change. Open an issue
  first for substantial behavior, security, release, or governance work.
- Whenever changes for an issue or ticket are implemented and you are confident
  in them, always create a branch, commit and push the changes, and open a pull
  request. Validate first; if the work is not ready or confidence is low,
  report what remains instead of presenting it as complete.
- Sign off every commit under the DCO with `git commit -s`. Confirm the
  `Signed-off-by` trailer is parseable before pushing.
- Keep the repository's own hooks enabled. Do not use `--no-verify` to bypass a
  failing local guard; fix the cause or report the blocker.
- Fill out the pull request template, include the commands actually run, and
  link the issue. Use `Closes #<number>` only when merging the PR will satisfy
  the issue's acceptance criteria.
- Do not close an issue merely because a PR was opened. The repository's
  definition of done requires the change to be merged and its required CI and
  review gates to pass.
- Never weaken, rename, or bypass the aggregate `CI Success` gate to land a
  change. Do not force-merge breaking dependency majors; handle the break or
  close the update.

## Security, governance, and releases

- Never put vulnerability details in a public issue, discussion, or pull
  request. Route them through GitHub private vulnerability reporting as
  documented in `.github/SECURITY.md`.
- Confirm with the owner before changing rulesets, required checks, security
  controls, or other shared repository infrastructure. Preserve every unrelated
  control and read the live state back after a write.
- Keep third-party GitHub Actions pinned to immutable commit SHAs.
- Treat a `vX.Y.Z` tag push as a publication action. Before any release mutation,
  obtain explicit confirmation of the exact version and target commit and run
  the documented collision preflight.
- Never move or reuse a consumed tag, republish an npm version, edit immutable
  release assets, use `npm unpublish`, or race the trusted-publishing workflow
  with a manual publish. Classify partial-publication state before retrying and
  fix forward with a new patch when identities or bytes differ.
