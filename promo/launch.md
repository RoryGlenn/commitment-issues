# Launch kit

Maintainer material for putting `commitment-issues` in front of people. It is
not shipped in the npm package because `promo/` is outside the `package.json`
`files` allowlist.

Current technical baseline: v3.4.0 is live on npm, its immutable GitHub Release
contains the exact npm tarball and matching SLSA provenance, issue #39 is
closed, and the demo GIF, repository topics, and social preview are complete.
Recheck those signals on launch day rather than relying on this snapshot.

## Message and media kit

Lead with the developer's feedback loop before listing features. Keep this
three-part sequence intact across the repository README, next-release npm
metadata, Product Hunt description, LinkedIn, Reddit, and X:

> **Catch mistakes while they're still cheap to fix.**
>
> Commit normally. When a fixable problem appears, Commitment Issues gives you
> an immediate suggestion and the exact safe command to fix it before the first
> push. CI stays authoritative.
>
> Watch the 26-second workflow: commit → suggestion → `npm run commit:fix` →
> successful push.

Use the first sentence as the general short lead. Use all three paragraphs when
the surface allows more context; follow them with feature or compatibility
detail only after the value is clear. Product Hunt's compact combined tagline
is “Catch mistakes early with advisory-first Git hooks”; begin its description
with the canonical promise above. For a shorter X post, use:

> Catch mistakes while they're still cheap to fix. Get immediate, advisory Git
> feedback and the exact safe command before your first push. CI stays
> authoritative.

Recommended alt text for the comparison asset: “Without Commitment Issues: send
work, wait, find a mistake, and do it again. With Commitment Issues: spot and
fix the mistake first, then send once.”

## Blog post

The blog is a deliberate secondary angle: it opens with the blocking-hook and
habitual `--no-verify` problem, then connects that problem to the same
value-first promise. Product listings and short social posts should use the
feedback-loop lead above.

**Title:** Why I stopped letting pre-commit hooks block my commits

Many teams add Git hooks and develop the same reflex:

`git commit --no-verify`.

Blocking-by-default setups teach it. You're mid-thought, you commit a WIP, and a
hook rejects it because Prettier wanted different quotes — or worse, it
reformats and re-stages files you didn't mean to touch, or fails a test suite
you were about to fix in the next commit. The hook was trying to help. It just
picked the worst possible moment.

Once `--no-verify` becomes muscle memory, the hooks may as well not exist.

I wanted the opposite default: **catch mistakes while they're still cheap to
fix, then get out of the way.**

### Advisory-first

`commitment-issues` runs the checks you'd expect — ESLint, Prettier, missing-test
detection, and pushed-file tests — but by default it **reports** and lets your
commit through. You get a compact box: what it found, what's safe to do next, and
the command to fix it when you're ready. By default, your commit is not held
hostage.

When you _do_ want a hard gate, you opt in. Set `blockPushOnTestFailure: true` and
failing tests block a push. Strictness is a deliberate choice — not the default
that trains you to bypass it.

### Safe by construction

The fix commands refuse to do anything risky:

- `fix:staged` only touches staged files, and refuses to run when a file has both
  staged and unstaged changes.
- `commit:fix` refuses dirty tracked worktrees and commits found in local remote
  refs, protecting unstaged work and known pushed history.

Nothing mutates your work behind your back.

### One command, and it heals itself

```bash
npm install -D commitment-issues eslint@^9 prettier@^3
npx --no-install commitment-issues init
```

That wires the hooks and npm scripts — no hook manager needed. Hooks are notorious for
silently breaking — a `git clean`, a stale checkout, a teammate who never ran
the install lifecycle. `commitment-issues` ships a `doctor` that repairs the
wiring through `prepare`, composing it after a project-owned command when
needed, so it self-heals without overwriting project setup and works with Yarn
Classic too.

It supports local npm, pnpm 10, Yarn Classic 1.22.22, and Bun 1.3.14 installs.
The [compatibility matrix](../docs/compatibility.md) records the exact required
Linux, macOS, Windows, and Node.js evidence for each manager.

### The point

Catch mistakes while they're still cheap to fix. Hooks should be a helpful
teammate, not a bouncer: advisory by default, strict when you ask, with the
exact safe command when a fix is available.

It's MIT-licensed and on npm as `commitment-issues`. If the philosophy resonates —
or if you think I'm wrong — I'd love the feedback.

## Product Hunt preparation

Follow the official Product Hunt launch, posting, and featuring guidance linked
from issue #240. Use a personal account, complete any required onboarding, and
create a draft before selecting a launch date. The primary product URL should
point directly to the GitHub repository rather than to the supporting blog post.

The listing should:

- use `commitment-issues` as the product name;
- use “Catch mistakes early with advisory-first Git hooks” as the concise,
  value-first tagline and open the description with “Catch mistakes while
  they're still cheap to fix”;
- explain what the product does within Product Hunt's description limit;
- identify the maintainer as the maker;
- use relevant Developer Tools, Open Source, and GitHub topics when available;
- include the existing logo, social-preview artwork, and a legible product-flow
  gallery led by `assets/before-after.png` and supported by the demo GIF; and
- avoid superlatives, coordinated voting, or an upvote request.

### Ready-to-enter listing fields

This payload stays inside the stricter limits in Product Hunt's current
[posting guide](https://help.producthunt.com/en/articles/479557-how-to-post-a-product)
and
[launch preparation guide](https://www.producthunt.com/launch/preparing-for-launch).
The maintainer must still preview and approve every field in Product Hunt before
scheduling.

- **Primary URL:** `https://github.com/RoryGlenn/commitment-issues`
- **Name:** `commitment-issues`
- **Tagline (50/60 characters):** `Catch mistakes early with advisory-first Git hooks`
- **Description (254/260 characters):** `Catch mistakes while they're still cheap to fix. Commitment Issues spots Git workflow problems before your first push, suggests the exact safe command, and stays advisory by default. Local-only, telemetry-free, open source, for JavaScript and TypeScript.`
- **Pricing:** Free
- **Status:** Available now
- **Topics:** Developer Tools, Open Source, GitHub
- **Hunter and maker:** use Rory's eligible personal Product Hunt account and
  confirm the maker badge in the preview; do not use a company account.

### Upload-ready media pack

Use these files in this order. The thumbnail is Product Hunt's recommended
240×240 square and is under 3 MB. All four static gallery cards use the
recommended 1270×760 canvas and are under 130 KB. The gallery therefore remains
complete even if the optional GIF is not accepted or displayed.

| Order | Upload file                               | Purpose                                                              | Alt text                                                                                                                       |

|     2 | `assets/product-hunt-02-setup.png`        | The two installation and setup commands                              | Two commands install and set up Commitment Issues; the next commit then receives helpful checks.                               |
|     3 | `assets/product-hunt-03-advisory.png`     | A real advisory-style warning and its exact fix command              | By default, a commit continues while Commitment Issues identifies two fixable ESLint problems and suggests npm run commit:fix. |

|     5 | `assets/demo.gif`                         | Optional 26-second motion proof after the four self-contained stills | Commitment Issues setup, a non-blocking warning, the exact safe fix command, and a successful push.                            |

The editable source mapping is explicit:

- `assets/product-hunt-thumbnail.svg` →
  `assets/product-hunt-thumbnail.png`;
- `assets/before-after.svg` →
  `assets/product-hunt-01-before-after.png`;
- `assets/product-hunt-02-setup.svg` →
  `assets/product-hunt-02-setup.png`;
- `assets/product-hunt-03-advisory.svg` →
  `assets/product-hunt-03-advisory.png`; and
- `assets/product-hunt-04-safe-fix.svg` →
  `assets/product-hunt-04-safe-fix.png`.

The render workflow regenerates every PNG and rejects a stale export.

### Human-only first maker comment worksheet

Product Hunt's current
[commenting guidelines](https://help.producthunt.com/en/articles/10030102-commenting-guidelines)
reject LLM-generated comments. Rory must write and approve the final first
maker comment in his own voice. Use these prompts as a factual checklist, not
as copy to paste:

- what the project does and who it is for;
- the blocking-hook and habitual `--no-verify` problem;
- why advisory-first is the default;
- the safe-fix, local-only, and native-hook design choices;
- current JS/TS, Node, Yarn Plug'n'Play, shell, and GUI-client boundaries; and
- the specific tradeoffs on which feedback would be useful.

Add one personal detail that only the maintainer can supply: the real moment a
blocking hook made `--no-verify` feel easier than fixing the problem, what that
experience cost, and why this different default was worth building. End with a
specific request for feedback rather than a request for votes.

Prepare personal answers for likely questions about Husky/lint-staged and CI,
bypasses, partial staging, telemetry and configured-command trust, monorepos,
platform compatibility, the proposed v4 direction, release verification, and
the v3.3.0/v3.3.1 fix-forward history. The durable product answers live in the
FAQ; the maintainer should review the final listing and every reply for accuracy
and tone.

## Posting checklist

- [x] Generate and embed the demo GIF (`vhs promo/demo.tape` → `assets/demo.gif`).
- [x] Add the reusable before/after SVG and 1200×675 social PNG.
- [x] Prepare the Product Hunt-native 240×240 thumbnail and four-card
      1270×760 static gallery, with deterministic source/export checks.
- [x] Align the README, next-release npm metadata, rationale, Product Hunt, and
      cross-platform post copy around the same value-first message; the blog
      reinforces it from the documented blocking-hook angle.
- [ ] Confirm the live npm page carries the new description and README after
      the next release.
- [x] Add GitHub repo topics: `git-hooks`, `husky`, `lint-staged`, `pre-commit`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `developer-tools`.
- [x] Add a social preview image (Settings → General → Social preview).
- [x] Publish and independently verify v3.4.0, including matching npm/GitHub
      tarballs and signed SLSA provenance.
- [ ] Re-run the clean-install launch path: `init`, advisory commit warning,
      `commit:fix`, and related push-time tests.
- [ ] Recheck npm, the immutable GitHub Release assets, CI, CodeQL, DCO,
      Scorecard, README media, and repository availability on launch day.
- [ ] Publish the blog on your site; cross-post to DEV with a canonical link back.
- [ ] Confirm the personal Product Hunt account can post and has completed any
      required onboarding.
- [ ] Create and review the Product Hunt draft, direct repository URL, tagline,
      description, topics, maker attribution, gallery, and first maker comment.
- [ ] Schedule the launch for a day when the maintainer can stay available after
      Product Hunt's 12:01 a.m. PT launch boundary.
- [ ] Post the first maker comment promptly and reserve launch-day time for
      technical replies and feedback triage.
- [ ] Start milestone #2's 14-day validation window after the launch.
